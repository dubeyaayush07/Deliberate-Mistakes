I am not saying every book is like this, some books are insightful and bring new ideas and perspectives to the table. But I have noticed that some authors have an idea and without fleshing it out and properly researching it they decide to write a book about it. Throw in cognitive dissonance, confirmation bias and an incompetent publishers and you have got yourself a popular non-fiction book. There is no peer review and if you sensationalize things you can earn a lot of money. </p>\n<p>You cannot even trust books by experts in the field. I bought into the hype of the book Why We Sleep  by Matthew Walker the author seemed legit and well respected within his field. He even appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience. After reading the book I  began espousing the benefits of 8 hour sleep until I read <a href=\"https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/\">this</a> wonderful article by Alexey Guzey. So who should you trust? Should you stop reading non-fiction altogether? I suggest doing the opposite, read as much as you can and be wary of any broad sweeping statements. Even though some books might get something wrong, the good ideas are still valuable. And as with business you can only get better at it (i.e. filtering signal) by exposing yourself to more of it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"New York Times Best Seller Business Book","date":"December 08, 2020","description":"What it takes to be successful."}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/rethinking-social-media/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rethinking Social Media"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"8301a84c-7a80-504f-821a-4e505679b908","previousPostId":"4bce58d4-d4d9-5ff3-b2a7-f63fd925e9bb","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2241071305","2841359383"]}
